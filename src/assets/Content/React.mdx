# Basic Questions
---
<div id="basic">
  ## 1.What is React, and how does it work?
  React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a virtual DOM to optimize the process of updating the actual DOM by comparing it to a virtual representation and only making necessary changes.

  ## 2.What are the key features of React?
  Key features include the virtual DOM, component-based architecture, unidirectional data flow, JSX syntax, and declarative UI.

  ## 3.What is the difference between React and other frameworks like Angular or Vue?
  React is a library focused on the view layer, while Angular and Vue are full-fledged frameworks that include tools for routing, state management, and more.

  ## 4.What is JSX? Why do we use it in React?
  JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows HTML-like structures to be written in JavaScript code. React uses JSX to define components and render UI.

  ## 5.What is the virtual DOM?
  The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses to optimize updates by comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM and updating only the changed elements.

  ## 6.What is the difference between functional and class components?
  Functional components are simpler and stateless, while class components support state and lifecycle methods. With hooks, functional components can now manage state and lifecycle events as well.

  ## 7.What is the role of render() in React?
  render() is a method in class components that returns JSX, which is rendered to the DOM.

  ## 8.What is the purpose of React keys?
  Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed from a list, optimizing performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders.

  ## 9.Explain the concept of one-way data binding in React.
  In React, data flows in one direction, from parent to child components via props, ensuring predictable and manageable UI states.

  ## 10.What is a React element?
  A React element is an immutable object that describes how a section of the UI should appear. It is the building block of React components.

  ## 11.What are props in React?
  Props are read-only attributes passed from parent components to child components in React.

  ## 12.What is the difference between props and state in React?
  Props are immutable and passed to components by their parent, while state is mutable and managed locally by the component.

  ## 13.How do you create a React application?
  You can create a React application by running the command npx create-react-app my-app or setting it up manually with tools like Webpack, Babel, and React.

  ## 14.What are fragments in React?
  Fragments are used to group multiple child elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

  ## 15.What is the purpose of ReactDOM.render()?
  ReactDOM.render() is used to render a React element or component to the actual DOM.

  ## 16.What is the difference between React.Component and React.PureComponent?
  React.Component does not implement shouldComponentUpdate by default, while React.PureComponent implements it with a shallow comparison of props and state to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

  ## 17.What is React’s declarative approach?
  React’s declarative approach allows developers to describe what the UI should look like at any point in time, with React automatically updating the DOM to match the desired state.

  ## 18.How does React handle events?
  React wraps browser events in a synthetic event system that provides consistent behavior across different browsers.

  ## 19.What is a higher-order component (HOC)?
  A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with added functionality, such as authentication or logging.

  ## 20.What is the purpose of React.Children?
  React.Children is a utility that provides methods to work with child elements, such as map, forEach, count, etc.

  ## 21.What is reconciliation in React?
  Reconciliation is the process by which React determines which changes need to be made to the DOM by comparing the previous virtual DOM with the new one.

  ## 22.Can browsers read JSX directly?
  No, JSX must be transpiled into JavaScript code using a tool like Babel before it can be executed in the browser.

  ## 23.What is the difference between a controlled and uncontrolled component?
  Controlled components have their state managed by React, while uncontrolled components manage their own state via the DOM.

  ## 24.What is React.StrictMode?
  React.StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential issues in an application, such as unsafe lifecycle methods, deprecated APIs, or unexpected side effects.

  ## 25.What are portals in React?
  Portals allow you to render children into a DOM node outside of the parent component hierarchy, typically for rendering modals or tooltips.

  Components and State Management (25 Questions)
  ## 26.What is a React component?
  A React component is a JavaScript function or class that returns a part of the UI (typically JSX) based on input data and state.

  ## 27.How do you create a functional component in React?
  You create a functional component by writing a function that returns JSX. Example:

  Copy code
  <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={atomOneDark}>
    {`
  function MyComponent() {
    return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
  }
  `}
  </SyntaxHighlighter>
  ## 28.How do you manage state in a functional component?
  You use the useState hook to manage state in a functional component. Example:

  js
  Copy code
  <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={atomOneDark}>
    {`
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  `}
  </SyntaxHighlighter>

  ## 29.What is the useState hook? Provide an example.
  The useState hook is used to add state to functional components. Example:

  js
  Copy code
  <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={atomOneDark}>
    {`
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  `}
  </SyntaxHighlighter>
  ## 30.What is the difference between stateful and stateless components?
  Stateful components manage and track state, while stateless components only receive props and render UI based on those props.

  ## 31.How do you pass data from a parent to a child component?
  You pass data through props, which are read-only values that the child component receives from the parent.

  ## 32.What are default props? How do you set them?
  Default props are values that are set for a component’s props in case the parent does not pass them. You set them like this:

  js
  Copy code
  <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={atomOneDark}>
    {`
  MyComponent.defaultProps = {
    name: 'Default Name',
  };
  `}
  </SyntaxHighlighter>
  ## 33.What is the context API?
  The context API allows you to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props to each level, avoiding prop drilling.

  ## 34.What is prop drilling, and how do you solve it?
  Prop drilling occurs when you pass props through many layers of components. You can solve it using the context API or state management libraries like Redux.

  ##What is lifting state up in React?
  Lifting state up involves moving the state to a common parent component so that multiple child components can share the same state.

  ## 35.What is the difference between local state and global state in React?
  Local state is specific to a component and managed within it, while global state is shared across multiple components, typically managed with tools like Redux or the context API.

  ## 36.How do you manage global state in React?
  Global state can be managed using the context API or state management libraries like Redux, MobX, or Recoil.

  ## 37.What is setState, and how does it work?
  setState is a method in class components that updates the component’s state and triggers a re-render of the component.

  ## 38.What is the importance of the callback in setState?
  The callback in setState is executed after the state has been updated, allowing you to perform actions based on the updated state.

  ## 39.What are React refs, and how do you use them?
  Refs are used to access DOM nodes directly or store mutable values. Example:

  js
  Copy code
  <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={atomOneDark}>
    {`
  const inputRef = useRef();
  `}
  </SyntaxHighlighter>

  ## 40.What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled inputs?
  Controlled inputs are bound to state, and their value is controlled by React, while uncontrolled inputs are handled by the DOM.

  ## 41.What is getDerivedStateFromProps used for?
  getDerivedStateFromProps is a lifecycle method used to update state based on props before a component renders.

  ## 42.What is the purpose of shouldComponentUpdate?
  shouldComponentUpdate allows you to prevent unnecessary re-renders
