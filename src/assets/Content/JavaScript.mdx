# Basic Questions

## 1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language used to create dynamic and interactive content on websites. It is a core web technology, alongside HTML and CSS.
## 2. What is a variable?
A variable is a named container that allows you to store data in your code.
## 3. What is a function?
A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
## 4. What is a loop?
A loop is a control flow statement that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times.
## 5. What is a conditional statement?
A conditional statement is a control flow statement that allows you to execute different code based on a certain condition.
## 6. What is a comment?
A comment is a line of code that is not executed by the computer, but is used to provide additional information or instructions to the code.
## 7. What is a data type?
A data type is a category that defines the type of data a variable can hold.
## 8. What is a primitive data type?
A primitive data type is a basic data type that cannot be broken down into smaller parts.
## 9. What is a non-primitive data type?
A non-primitive data type is a data type that can be broken down into smaller parts.
## 10. What is a closure?
A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which it was defined.
## 11. What is a prototype?
A prototype is a built-in object that is used to create and manage objects in JavaScript.
## 12. What is a constructor function?
A constructor function is a function that is used to create objects.
## 13. What is a class?
A class is a template for creating objects.
## 14. What is a prototype chain?

# Intermediate Questions

## 1. What is a callback function?
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function.
## 2. What is a promise?
A promise is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation.
## 3. What is a closure?
A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which it was defined.
## 4. What is a prototype?
A prototype is a built-in object that is used to create and manage objects in JavaScript.
## 5. What is a constructor function?
A constructor function is a function that is used to create objects.
## 6. What is a class?
A class is a template for creating objects.
## 7. What is a prototype chain?
A prototype chain is a chain of objects that are used to create and manage objects in JavaScript.
## 8. What is a generator function?
A generator function is a function that can yield multiple values over time using the yield keyword. It returns an iterator that can be used to control the flow of function execution.
## 9. What is a proxy?
A proxy is an object that is used to intercept and modify the behavior of another object.
## 10. What is a decorator?
A decorator is a function that is used to modify the behavior of another function or object.

# Advanced Questions

## 1. What is a module?
A module is a file that contains code (variables, functions, classes) that can be exported and imported by other files to maintain separation of concerns and modularity.
## 2. What is a shallow copy?
A shallow copy copies only the top-level properties of an object or array.
## 3. What is a deep copy?
A deep copy recursively copies all levels of an object or array, including nested objects or arrays.
## 4. What is a generator function?
A generator function is a function that can yield multiple values over time using the yield keyword. It returns an iterator that can be used to control the flow of function execution.
## 5. What is a proxy?
A proxy is an object that is used to intercept and modify the behavior of another object.
## 6. What is a decorator?
A decorator is a function that is used to modify the behavior of another function or object.
## 7. What is a closure?
